This is a virtual painting python script built using opencv and mediapipe
Its purpose is to eliminate the use of the traditional way of making notes i.e by using pen and paper and even going further 
this project help us in advancement of learning and technology by replacing the digital note pads.

technologies we have used 
1.opencv 
-> OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.
-> To put it simply, it is a library used for image processing. In fact, it is a huge open-source library used for computer vision        applications, in areas powered by Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning algorithms, and for completing tasks that need image processing.

2.mediapipe
->MediaPipe is an open-source framework from Google for building machine learning (ML) solutions for mobile, web, desktop, edge devices, and IoT
->The MediaPipe Object Detector task lets you detect the presence and location of multiple classes of objects.
